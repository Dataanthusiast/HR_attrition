# HR_attrition
Problem: To see the most common and insightful reasons for attrition data of a company so that they can observe the employee behaviour on the basis of their age, marital status, level of experience, education bg etc.

Data description: The data contains different columns like 
Department- Department has several fields for which we have the data like Human Resources Research & Development and Sales
Age- To see the age factor in attrition of the employees this age column gave us the perspective to know which age group is involved in the attrition.
Education Background- Observing the role of educational background to see which educational background has more job opportunities which could be the reason behind the attrition.
Gender - To see if the attrition is gender biased,  this column played an important role.
Marital status - Married couple seems to look for stability, so this column was intended to check their interest in a job.
Experience - Seeing the changes in the decision of the employees taken on the basis of their experience.
